#
# Names that only the shell's `template.min.css` defines (shell-classes.txt: the paid/plan family,
# .selector-box*, .empty-alert) are listed separately and do not fail the check — they paint inside

# --app-prefix may be repeated, or given a comma-separated list. A new app should need one prefix;
# an existing one usually has many, and listing them is how you get from "166 findings" to the few
# that are actually wrong.

# Use `find` rather than src/**/*.html: that glob only recurses in zsh.
#
# It reads class="…" / className="…" / className={`…`} attributes, so it covers plain HTML,
# Angular and Vue templates and JSX alike. Class names your code composes at runtime
# ("badge-status-" + status) are invisible to it — that is what verify.mjs catches in the DOM.
# This is the cheap check; verify.mjs is the thorough one.
